# Homework 04: Requirements Testing

## Part 1:  Inspect the triangle requirements below.


### Exceptions

- 1.1 contains ambiguity
- 2.2 contains ambiguity
- 3.1 unknown terms
- 4.1 unknown terms


### Notes

- 1.1 Doesn't define what kind of number(s) for example whole numbers, integers, etc..
- 2.2 The requirements is to check for real numbers which is not specific since these are real numbers (1, 15.82, âˆ’0.1, 3/4).  I was given a valid lower bound zero, but I cannot quantify "not too big."
- 3.1 and 4.1 are using letters with no definition of what those letters mean

Since the overall requirements were simple; didn't allow for room for error or several factors didn't apply (was the requirement a repeat in other artifacts or were all stakeholders considered) since I was only handed a list of requirements (i.e no context)

## Part 2:

###  traceability matrix


|                                | Test Cases |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| Requirements                   |            |
| 2.1 - Must be greater than 0   | T1         |
| 2.1 - Must be less than 1000   | T2         |
| 2.1 - Must be a real number    | T3         |
| 3.1 - Must be a legal triangle | T4         |
| 4.1 - If Right triangle        | T5         |
| 5.1 - If Equilateral triangle  | T6         |
| 5.1 - If Isosceles triangle    | T7         |
| 6.1 - Right Isosceles Triangle | T8         |
| 6.2 - Right Scalene Triangle   | T9         |
| 6.3 - Equilateral Triangle     | T10        |
| 6.4 -Isosceles Triangle        | T11        |

#### reference

- equilateral triangles have all three sides with the same length
- isosceles triangles have two sides with the same length
- scalene triangles have three sides with different lengths
- right triangles have three sides with lengths, a, b, and c where a2 + b2 = c2
